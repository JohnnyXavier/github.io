## About Me

<p class="message">
  Hi there!<br>
  My name is John Xavier, a tech enthousiast writting some notes on the web
</p>

## About io_forge
I started writing these notes:

* To track some info that was hard to come by over the net in a single place
* To practice a few topics by trying to explain them
* to share a few findings I found myself when trying to figure out some strange problems

Feel free to share, use and modify any or all pieces of code or procedures you find here.<br>
Mind that no solution proposed here is a definite solution, or the best solution
or sometimes even maybe a bad solution.<br>
Use the site knowing that there is no guarantee that your neighbour's wig won't catch fire if you implement 
an algorithm from this site.

As my knowledge, tools, frameworks, versions, etc, evolve, so will the solutions.
