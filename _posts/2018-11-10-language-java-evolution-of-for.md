Lets show the different alternatives of the for  loop in java applied to a List<Strings>

Defining the `List<String>` we will use across the code:

```java
List names = Arrays.asList("foo","bar","baz");
```


### *Standard  for  loop*
this is the for loop found in different programming languages

```java
for (int i = 0; i < names.size(); i++) {
            doSomething(names.get(i));
        }
```

### *Iterator for  loop*
slightly variation of the standard for loop, note how we keep all 3 parts of the standard for  loop but the break condition uses the i.hasNext()  and the increment is in the loopâ€™s body as i.next()

```java
for (Iterator<String> i = names.iterator(); i.hasNext(); )
            doSomething(i.next());
```


### *added in J5, forEach  loop*
note how the above iterator ceremony has been replaced by this new approach
although not a silver bullet it is a very convenient way of forward traversing this Collection<br>
[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/foreach.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/foreach.html)
```java
for (String name : names) {
            doSomething(name);
        }
```


### *added in J8, forEach  Loop associated to the Collection  with lambda expression*
```java
names.forEach(name -> doSomething(name));
```


### *added in J8, forEach  Loop associated to the Collection  with method reference*
```java
names.forEach(this::doSomething);
```

### *as a bonus, an oldie not very known... the `ListIterator<T>` added in J2 is close to the `iterator` with the added possibility of backwards traversing a list*
it is basically written as as iterator with the difference that when you want to traverse backwards a list you specify the element on the list you want use as the point from where you want to move backwards.
We are going to start from the very end of the list in this example.

forward
```java
// traversing forward
// same form as the Iterator  but we use the ListIterator interface instead
for (ListIterator<String> listIterator = names.listIterator(); listIterator.hasNext(); ) {
    doSomething(listIterator.next());
}
```

backwards
```java
// traversing backwards
// we specify here the size of the list to position the iterator cursor at the very end of the list
for (ListIterator<String> listIterator = names.listIterator(names.size()); listIterator.hasPrevious(); ) {
    doSomething(listIterator.previous());
}
}
```
