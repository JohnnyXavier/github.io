# /the_one_on_generating_jsons_from_column_data
the first 3 notes helped introduce our subject and setup the db and the pieces to support a working project.<br>
this note will dive into the json functionality we can see in postgres to help build json data. This will be really useful later on when we switch over to full nosql with `json` and `jsonb` data types

this is all for now on the fourth note on postgres noSql.
