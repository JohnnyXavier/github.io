This note is about composition usage tips and tricks on the app.

---

the app is written in **java {{ site.showcase.java-version }}** and on this note we are going to tackle a few places where OOP techniques
were used.

I will not define oop. For a formal definition and discussion here I leave
the [wikipedia entry for OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)

each OOP section will tackle some OOP feature present in the app.
