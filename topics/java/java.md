# /some_notes_on_java

I will post here a few notes on Java and some of it's frameworks.

Feel free to use part or the whole of the code here and as written in the index

> ###### examples and solutions in this site are just one of many possible approaches to solve a given problem

As the language itself and the frameworks evolve a few notes will feel outdated.
The evolution of the `for` loop, and how looping through `collections` is approached is a good example on how something
so simple and ubiquitous, evolved over the years and versions.


## /Language
