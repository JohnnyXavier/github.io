# Some_notes_about_{{ site.showcase.name }}
---

This is a collection of notes about **{{ site.showcase.name }}**, a showcase application to demonstrate skills, technologies and explore
some interesting tricks and tech in a rounded usable application.

---

given the nature of software developer's interviews, this application began as a means to showcase skills and new technologies and also be
of use as guide for the chosen tech in a complex and "big" codebase.<br>

**{{ site.showcase.name }}** aims to be a **project management tool** backed up by boards, scheduling, tasks and to-dos,
statistics, and predictions.<br>
the kind of tool that has been around for a long time, with many successful variants. If you check [alternativeto.net](https://alternativeto.net/)
you will find several paying, freemium and free apps under the following categories that achieve the same as **{{ site.showcase.name }}**:

* [issue-tracking](https://alternativeto.net/category/developer-tools/issue-tracking/)
* [kanban tool](https://alternativeto.net/browse/search/?q=kanban)
* [task management](https://alternativeto.net/category/productivity/task-management/)

there are hundreds if not thousands of alternatives and dozens of well established applications in the project / task management space. I
chose this type of app on purpose as it would make it easy to convey skills and intentions on an established problem space. It also poses
difficult enough problems that are interesting as a showcase and teaching application to work on.

it is likely you reached this site after an interview, checking my **[LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnnyvera)** or
looking for a solution for the tech stack used here.<br>
I hope you enjoy reading the notes and drop me a line if you find this interesting, find a bug, or need some clarification about code, tech
or the notes themselves.
