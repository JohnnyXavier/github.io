# Some_notes_about_{{ site.showcase.name }}

This is a collection of notes about **{{ site.showcase.name }}**, a showcase application to demonstrate skills, technologies and explore
some interesting tricks and tech in a rounded usable application.

This application began as a means to showcase skills and new technologies, given the nature of software developer's interviews.<br>
