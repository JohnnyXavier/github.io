# bare_metal_code
is a collection of notes on topics I found interesting, random, or that helped me while I was studying a particular subject.

they range from small snippets to bigger projects, all in the spirit of practicing some tech.

it all started during commuting to work on the northern line in London's Tube checking out github pages and killing some time.

I hope you find these pages useful and don't be shy to drop a line over github if you find a mistake, have a suggestion or want me to write a note on a particular topic.

cheers!
