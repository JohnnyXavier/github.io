<h1>Some notes about Java</h1>

<hr>

this notes show some examples on my particular setup, which can be:
* ubuntu linux (usually latest version)
* OpenSuSE: Tumbleweed (rolling distro)
* java running on openJDK

there are a few sections on how to install different java VMs, they all assume a GNU\Linux as operating system, ubuntu or OpenSuse ones in particular.
