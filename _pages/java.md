# Some notes about Java

---

this notes show some examples on my particular setup, which can be:
* [Manjaro linux - kde variant](https://manjaro.org/)
* [OpenSuSE linux - tumbleweed](https://www.opensuse.org/)
* [KUbuntu linux](https://kubuntu.org/)
* java running on [openJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/)

there are a few sections on how to install different java VMs, they all assume a GNU\Linux as operating system, Ubuntu / OpenSuse / Manjaro one's in particular.
