<h1>Some notes about Java</h1>

<hr>

this notes show some examples on my particular setup, which is:
* ubuntu linux (usually latest version)
* java running on openJDK

there are a few sections on how to install different java VMs, they all assume a debian based Linux distro as operating system, ubuntu ones in particular.
