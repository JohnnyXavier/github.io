<h1>Some notes about C++</h1>

<hr>

this notes show some examples on my particular setup, which can be:
* [Manjaro linux - kde variant](https://manjaro.org/)
* [OpenSuSE linux - tumbleweed](https://www.opensuse.org/)
* [KUbuntu linux](https://kubuntu.org/)
* **[Gnu](https://www.gnu.org/)** [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/), and sometimes **[LLVM](https://llvm.org/)** [CLang](https://clang.llvm.org/)

there are a few sections on how to install different compilers and utilities, they all assume a `GNU\Linux` as operating system, Ubuntu / OpenSuse / Manjaro one's in particular.
