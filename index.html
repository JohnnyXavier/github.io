<div class="align-right">Some notes about programming</div>
<br>
<hr>
<p>I started writing these notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To track some info that was hard to come by over the net</li>
  <li>To practice a few topics by trying to explain them</li>
  <li>To share a few findings I found when trying to figure out some strange problems</li>
</ul>

<p>Mind that not a single solution proposed here is a definite solution, or the best solution
  or sometimes even may be a bad solution.<br/>
  Use the site knowing that there is no guarantee that your neighbour’s wig won’t catch fire if you follow
  a note from here.</p>

<p>As my knowledge, tools, frameworks, versions, etc, evolve, so will the solutions.</p>
