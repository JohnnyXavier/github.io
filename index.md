## /some notes on programming, challenges, and self practice
I will be posting a few simple to real examples that helped me understand or review some concepts.
Real examples are the ones that usually do not make lots of sense but are closer to 
scenarios where impossible/unusual constrains drive the projects

These examples helped me practice or are hosted here as a quick personal reference to save time browsing the web.

Use them in full or in part if they help you out, but mind that...
